## Note
- Please note that the interface is in Chinese by default. An English version has been added to the form, but it hasn't been tested yet.
- The current font style for title is `Bradley Hand ITC`, and for content it's `Calibri`. This is based on my personal habit. It's adjustable in the code, and related features may be added later.
